<p align="center"> This is just a simple Express API (NodeJS) that sends saved surveys to registered users' email and calculates NPS (Net Promoter Score) based on received users' survey answers. It's a project made during NLW#4 event promoted by üöÄ Rocketseat on their NodeJS path. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Net_Promoter#:~:text=The%20Net%20Promoter%20Score%20is%20calculated%20by%20subtracting%20the%20percentage,of%20customers%20who%20are%20Promoters.">  Learn more about NPS Score</a>

## üßê About <a name = "about"></a>

The purpose of my participation on this event was of just curiosity. I've been told how great Rocketseat was, so I thought that I should get to know them better as well and see wether I'd learn something new. I liked those new (for me) libraries they chose to work on this project.

This API can register user's e-mail, save survey's questions, re/send an e-mail of any desired survey to any user's e-mail, receive a user's answer with a score in a range from 1 to 10.
I did add just a few fixes for original code and despite the fact they were so simple IMHO I think those should have been addressed during their presentation.

## üèÅ Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>


### Prerequisites

Clone the repository

```
git clone https://github.com/trepichio/nps_api.git
```

### Installing

Follow these instructions once you're at project's root path in your favorite terminal.

Install dependencies

```
npm install
```

Rename .env.example file to .env

```
mv .env.example .env
```

by _default_ this web server will run at _port 3399_. If you want to run in a different port just open the .env file and change both the PORT variable and port value in URL_MAIL and save it.

run the migrations to create databse and its tables

```
npm run typeorm -- migration:run
```

and then run web server

```
npm run dev
```

Then you can consume one of its endpoints using your favourite REST API tool such as [Postman](https://www.postman.com/), [Insomnia](https://insomnia.rest/) or any other.

For example:
(GET) http://localhost:3399/surveys/ to retrieve all surveys from database or
(POST) http://localhost:3399/sendMail/ to send a saved survey to a registered user email, both parameters must be provided in the body of this request. More details about in section [Usage](#usage).

## üîß Running the tests <a name = "tests"></a>

You can run tests by

```
npm run test
```

Some tests are already coded that tests things such as if it can create users, avoid create a new user with an already existent email, can get a list of surveys and create new surveys.
